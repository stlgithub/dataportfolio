# Introduction

NOTE: Unfortunately Power BI does not allow users to upload their works online without a work or school email. As I do not have such an email, I had to upload only screenshots of my projects.
You can download the Power Bi files [by clicking here.](https://github.com/stlgithub/dataportfolio/blob/main/powerbi_files/Project2.pbix)

The dataset used in this project breaks down NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year.
The dataset can be found by [clicking here.](https://data.world/jbaucke/2021-w1-power-bi-wow-ncaa-financials).

This project breaks down the revenues, profits, and expenses of the NCAA in a vertical, smart device friendly visualisation..

# Steps Taken

### 1. Data preparation

First I cleaned the data to remove null values and unwanted data.
I then created a new field that calculates total profits, 

### 2. Vertical settings

I adjusted the size and shape of the dashboard to be vertical, to simulate a dashboard that could be viewed on a smartphone or simlilar device.

### 3. Dashboard

I then created views, using a linechart, barchart, and other selected information displayed using cards, for Revenues, Expenses and Profits.

### 4. SWITCH()

I created a measure using the SWITCH() function, to allow the user to change between each report, so that not only the correct information is displayed, but that the colors of the report also change to match which of the pages is being viewed.
