# Introduction

This project examines Austin Animal Center's Intakes and Outcomes based on factors such as the animals breed and sex.

# Steps Taken

### 1. Data preparation

I made sure to filter the data used so that it would only display data from after the year 2013. Besides this, only minimal clean up was needed to be done.

### 2. Dashboard

For the dashboard I created a table showing the outcomes and intakes of each animal type.

Next, I created column charts displaying outcomes based on the outcome type, as well as the sex of the animal.

Finally, I created a barchart to display outcome by animal breed, and a slicer to change between the years from which the data is displayed.
