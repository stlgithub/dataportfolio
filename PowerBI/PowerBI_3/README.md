# Introduction

NOTE: Unfortunately Power BI does not allow users to upload their works online without a work or school email. As I do not have such an email, I had to upload only screenshots of my projects.

The dataset used in this project breaks down NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year.
The dataset can be found by [clicking here.](https://data.world/jbaucke/2021-w1-power-bi-wow-ncaa-financials).

this project uses the maximum ice coverage data from NOAAâ€™s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory.

# Steps Taken

### 1. Data preparation

Firstly I used Power Query to transfrom all of the individual lake columns in the dataset into rows.

### 2. Matrix and Conditional Formatting

Then I created a matrix to visualise the ice coverage by lake and year.
Using conditional formatting I made it so that the color of the ice coverage would change between five different colors, based on selected variables.
                
### 3. Dashboard elements

Afterwards, I added the rest of the visualisations on the dasboard; the column chart, the linechart with a trendline, and the slicer to select the desired range of years.

### 4. Forecasting

I then created the second page, in which I added another line chart with forecasting all the way to the year 2030.

### 5. Anomaly Detection

In a second linechart on the same page, I displayed the anomalies at 75% sensitivity.

### 6. Smart Narrative

I also added a Smart Narrative to the left hand side of the dashboard. I did not alter it at all, as I only wanted to demonstrate that the functionality is there in case I wanted to use it.
