                !!! NOTE: Unfortunately Power BI does not allow users to upload their works online without a work or school email. As I do not have such an email, I had to upload only screenshots of my projects. If you would like to download the Power Bi files from my GitHub page, <a href="https://github.com/stlgithub/dataportfolio/blob/main/powerbi_files/Project3.pbix">click here.</a> !!!<br><br>
                The dataset used in this project breaks down NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year. The dataset can be found by <a href="https://data.world/jbaucke/2021-w1-power-bi-wow-ncaa-financials">clicking here.</a><br>
                The steps I took in this project:<br>
                I adjusted the size and shape of the dashboard to be vertical, to simulate a dashboard that could be viewed on a smartphone or simlilar device.<br>
                I then created views, using a linechart, barchart, and other selected information displayed using cards, for Revenues, Expenses and Profits.<br>
                I created a measure using the SWITCH() function, to allow the user to change between each report, so that not only the correct information is displayed, but that the colors of the report also change to match which of the pages is being viewed.<br>
