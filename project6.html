               <br> !!! NOTE: Unfortunately Power BI does not allow users to upload their works online without a work or school email. As I do not have such an email, I had to upload only screenshots of my projects. If you would like to download the Power Bi files from my GitHub page, <a href="https://github.com/stlgithub/dataportfolio/blob/main/powerbi_files/Project6.pbix">click here.</a> !!!<br><br>
                This project uses data from GapMinder. The dataset can be found by <a href="https://data.world/missdataviz/wow2021-w11">clicking here.</a><br><br>
                The steps I took in this project:<br><br>
                First I transformed the data by unpivoting the country columns for each table. I also created a Year table to use as the time in my charts.<br>
                After some additional data cleaning, I created a bubble chart showing life expecanty by average income over time, with each bubble representing a region by color, and population size by size.<br>
                I then created a custom overlay on a seperate page, that shows the specific country as well as life expecanty, income and population size when you hover over the bubbles.<br>
