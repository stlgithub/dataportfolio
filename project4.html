               <br> !!! NOTE: Unfortunately Power BI does not allow users to upload their works online without a work or school email. As I do not have such an email, I had to upload only screenshots of my projects.

                The dataset in this project uses the maximum ice coverage data from NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. The dataset can be found by <a href="https://data.world/dataveld/wow2021week07">clicking here.</a><br><br>
                The steps I took in this project:<br><br>
                Firstly I used Power Query to transfrom all of the individual lake columns in the dataset into rows.<br>
                Then I created a matrix to visualise the ice coverage by lake and year.<br>
                Using conditional formatting I made it so that the color of the ice coverage would change between five different colors, based on selected variables.<br>
                Afterwards, I added the rest of the visualisations on the dasboard; the column chart, the linechart with a trendline, and the slicer to select the desired range of years.<br>
                I then created the second page, in which I added another line chart with forecasting all the way to the year 2030.<br>
                In a second linechart on the same page, I displayed the anomalies at 75% sensitivity.<br>
                I also added a Smart Narrative to the left hand side of the dashboard. I did not alter it at all, as I only wanted to demonstrate that the functionality is there in case I wanted to use it.<br>
