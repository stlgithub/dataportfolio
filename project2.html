As I do not have such an email, I had to upload only screenshots of my projects.

                The dataset used in this project breaks down NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year. The dataset can be found by <a href="https://data.world/jbaucke/2021-w1-power-bi-wow-ncaa-financials">clicking here.</a><br><br>
                The steps I took in this project:<br><br>
                First I cleaned the data to remove null values and unwanted data.<br>
                I then created a new field that calculates total profits, after which I created a KPI dashboard including a linechart and a bar chart for the revenues, expenses, and profits on each conference.<br>
                I added a slicer for picking a desired year, and made sure it only altered the KPI and barchard, not the line chart.<br>
                I created a second page to showcase the same information, but this time for Schools rather than the conferences.<br><br>
                After all of this, I added Accessibility features to the analysis:<br>
                Firstly I made sure the colors of the page have good enough of a contrast, using contrastchecker.com.<br>
                I added alt text to every element of the dashboard, to help with screenreaders. I also made sure each element has a descriptive title, even if its hidden in the visualisation.<br>
                Finally, I adjusted the tab order of the elements used in the dasboard.
