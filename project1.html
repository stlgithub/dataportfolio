                This project uses data from the City of Austin, Texas, regarding intake and outcomes at the Austin Animal Center from October 2013 to February 6th, 2021. The dataset can be found by <a href="url">clicking here.</a>
                The steps I took in this project:
                First I filtered the report page to only show years after 2013, and created a matrix to show intakes and outcomes by animal type.
                I then created a column chart to showcase the outcomes by animal sex, and a bar chart to showcase outcomes by breed.
                I added a horizontal slicer so the year value can be changed, and finally, improved the visuals to be more aesthetically pleasing.
