# Introduction
In this project I cleaned up a data about the Nashville Housing market.

You can see the code [here](https://github.com/stlgithub/dataportfolio/blob/main/SQL/SQL_2/data_cleanup.sql)

Data for this project comes from [Alex the Analyst's GitHub](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx).
