# Introduction
In this project I transformed and visualised coffee sales data.

You can check out the project on web based Excel here: [portfolio_project folder](/portfolio_project/)

Data for this project comes from [Mo Chen's GitHub](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx).

# Steps Taken

### 3. Calculated Sales

### 4. Formatted Order Date and Size

### 5. Created Pivot Tables and Charts

### 6. Updated data with XLOOKUP for the Loyalty Card column

### 7. Built a dashboard
