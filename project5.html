As I do not have such an email, I had to upload only screenshots of my projects.

                This project uses data originally sourced from the US Department of Agriculture, which contains data for Michigan's 83 counties of % population in poverty and % population who have completed a college education. The dataset can be found by <a href="https://data.world/dataveld/wow2021week15">clicking here.</a>
                The steps I took in this project:
                Firstly I made an inner join Merge of the two tables of data on the FIPS column. I also renamed the 2015-2019 column to be College Completed. I only used the poverty percentage column from the merge, from which I created a Column From Example to display the data as percentages.
                I then deleted the unwanted columns of data, and created bins for both College Completed as well as Poverty Percentage.
                I used a SWITCH() function to create 9 different combinations between the In Poverty and College Completed values, all of which were represented with different color coding, similar to conditional formatting.
                I then created a page for both, a ArcGIS Map and a Filled Map.
